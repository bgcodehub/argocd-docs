# ArgoCD Concepts and Terminology

## Overview
ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps-based continuous delivery tool designed to automate Kubernetes application deployment. It ensures that the live state of applications in a Kubernetes cluster matches the desired state defined in Git.

## Understanding ArgoCD
To work with ArgoCD effectively, familiarity with the following technologies is essential:
- **Git** – Version control for managing desired states.
- **Docker** – Containerization for application packaging.
- **Kubernetes** – Orchestration for containerized applications.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automation for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **GitOps Principles** – Managing infrastructure through Git-based workflows.

## Key Terminology

### **ArgoCD Application**
- In ArgoCD, an **application** represents a Kubernetes deployment managed through GitOps.
- It defines the **source** (e.g., Git repository) and **destination** (Kubernetes cluster) for deployment.

### **Application Source Type**
- Specifies the format of the Kubernetes manifests used in deployment.
- Common types include:
  - **Helm** – Templated Kubernetes manifests.
  - **Kustomize** – Layered customizations for Kubernetes configurations.
  - **Raw YAML or JSON** – Standard Kubernetes manifest definitions.

### **Target State vs. Live State**
- **Target State** – The desired state of an application, as defined in Git.
- **Live State** – The actual running state of the application in the Kubernetes cluster.
- ArgoCD continuously monitors and reconciles differences between these states.

### **Synchronization (Sync) Process**
- When ArgoCD detects drift between the target and live states, it attempts to **sync** the live state to match Git.
- Sync operations include:
  - Applying Kubernetes manifests.
  - Rolling out updates based on Git commits.
  - Reverting unintended changes.

### **Sync Status**
- Indicates whether the application in the cluster matches the desired state in Git.
- Possible statuses:
  - **Synced** – The application state matches Git.
  - **Out of Sync** – Differences exist between Git and the cluster.

### **Sync Operations**
- **Manual Sync** – Requires an administrator to trigger synchronization.
- **Automated Sync** – ArgoCD automatically applies updates when changes occur in Git.

### **Health Status**
- ArgoCD provides built-in health assessments for various Kubernetes resources.
- Health statuses include:
  - **Healthy** – The resource is operating as expected.
  - **Progressing** – The resource is undergoing changes.
  - **Degraded** – The resource has issues preventing normal operation.
  - **Missing** – Expected resources are absent.

## Summary
ArgoCD is a powerful tool that enables GitOps-driven Kubernetes deployments by continuously reconciling live and target states. Understanding its concepts and terminology helps engineers deploy and manage applications efficiently. By leveraging features like synchronization, health assessments, and multiple source types, teams can ensure reliable, automated application deployments.
