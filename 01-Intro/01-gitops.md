# Introduction to GitOps

## Overview
GitOps is a framework that automates the entire code delivery process using Git as the central source of truth. It includes infrastructure and application definition as code, allowing for seamless deployment, change management, and rollback processes.

## Core Principles of GitOps
1. **Declarative Infrastructure** - All infrastructure and application configurations are stored as code in a Git repository.
2. **Version Control as the Source of Truth** - The Git repository serves as the single source of truth for deployment configurations.
3. **Automated Deployment** - Changes committed to the Git repository trigger automated deployment pipelines.
4. **Continuous Monitoring and Reconciliation** - A GitOps operator ensures that the actual cluster state matches the desired state stored in Git.
5. **Rollback and Recovery** - Using Git-based version control, changes can be reverted quickly in case of failure.

## GitOps Workflow
1. **Developers Commit Code**
   - Developers push code to a shared repository using Git.
   - A feature branch is created as a copy of the main code base.
   
2. **CI/CD Pipeline Execution**
   - A CI service builds the code, runs unit tests, and prepares artifacts.
   - The changes are reviewed and approved before merging into the main branch.

3. **GitOps Operator Monitors the Repository**
   - A GitOps operator runs within a Kubernetes cluster, continuously monitoring the Git repository.
   - The operator detects changes and applies them to the cluster.

4. **Automatic Deployment and Synchronization**
   - Once changes are detected, the Kubernetes manifest is updated.
   - The GitOps operator ensures the cluster state aligns with the defined state in Git.

5. **Rollback and Disaster Recovery**
   - If necessary, a Git revert command can roll back changes to a previous state.
   - The GitOps operator automatically detects and restores the previous desired state if inconsistencies occur.

## Benefits of GitOps
- **Improved Auditability** - Every change is tracked in Git.
- **Enhanced Security** - Reduced need for direct cluster access.
- **Faster Deployments** - Automated deployments reduce manual intervention.
- **Simplified Rollbacks** - Reverting to a stable version is easy using Git commands.
- **Consistency Across Environments** - Ensures uniform deployments across multiple clusters.

## Conclusion
GitOps streamlines the software delivery process by using Git as the single source of truth. It enforces consistency, improves security, and enhances automation by ensuring that infrastructure and application configurations remain in sync with the defined state in version control. With GitOps, development teams can achieve faster, safer, and more reliable deployments in modern cloud-native environments.
