# GitOps Principles

## Overview
GitOps is a methodology for managing and automating infrastructure and application deployments using Git as the single source of truth. It provides a systematic approach to configuration management, ensuring consistency and reliability across environments.

## Four Core Principles of GitOps

### 1. **Declarative vs. Imperative Approach**
GitOps enforces a **declarative** approach rather than an **imperative** one.

- A declarative approach means defining the **desired state** of the system, rather than executing a sequence of commands to achieve that state.
- This ensures immutability and consistency across environments, making it easier to track changes and roll back if necessary.
- The imperative approach, on the other hand, requires manual intervention and a sequence of explicit commands, making reconciliation difficult.

### 2. **Version Control with Git**
Git acts as the **source of truth** in a GitOps workflow.

- All declarative files, also known as the **desired state**, are stored in a Git repository.
- This provides version control, ensuring that changes can be tracked, audited, and rolled back when necessary.
- By storing the system state in Git, teams can guarantee that infrastructure changes are recorded and controlled.

### 3. **Automated Synchronization with GitOps Operators**
GitOps employs **operators** (also known as software agents) that continuously monitor and apply the declared state stored in Git.

- These operators run within the Kubernetes cluster and automatically apply changes to ensure the system always matches the declared state.
- If a developer commits changes to the Git repository, the operator picks them up and applies them.
- This eliminates manual deployments and reduces human error.

### 4. **Reconciliation and Self-Healing**
A GitOps workflow ensures **continuous reconciliation**, keeping the system in the desired state.

- The GitOps operator follows a loop of **Observe → Diff → Act**:
  1. **Observe**: Continuously checks the Git repository for changes to the declared state.
  2. **Diff**: Compares the current cluster state with the desired state in Git.
  3. **Act**: Applies necessary changes to match the cluster state to the declared state.
- This ensures that the system is self-healing and automatically corrects any drift from the expected configuration.

## Benefits of GitOps
- **Improved stability and security**: Every change is tracked and auditable.
- **Faster deployments**: Automation reduces manual intervention and speeds up rollouts.
- **Rollback capability**: Since the entire state is versioned in Git, rolling back to a previous state is seamless.
- **Scalability**: Works across multiple clusters and environments with ease.

## Conclusion
GitOps simplifies and automates infrastructure and application management by leveraging Git as the single source of truth. By enforcing **declarative state**, **version control**, **automatic synchronization**, and **continuous reconciliation**, GitOps enhances reliability and efficiency in modern DevOps workflows.
