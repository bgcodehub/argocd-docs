# Understanding Reconciliation in ArgoCD

## Overview

The reconciliation function in **ArgoCD** is responsible for ensuring that the **actual state** of a **Kubernetes cluster** matches the **desired state** defined in a **Git repository**. This process ensures consistency between deployed applications and their Git configurations, making it a key feature in **GitOps-based workflows**.

In this section, we will explore:
- What a **reconciliation loop** is.
- How often ArgoCD **synchronizes** changes.
- How to **configure reconciliation timeout settings**.
- The use of **webhooks to trigger synchronization**.

## 1. Understanding the Reconciliation Loop

A **reconciliation loop** defines how frequently **ArgoCD** checks the Git repository and synchronizes the changes to the cluster.

### Key Points:
- In DevOps workflows, multiple commits may be pushed to Git **daily**.
- ArgoCD automatically checks for changes at a **default interval of 3 minutes**.
- This means that every 3 minutes, ArgoCD ensures that the **desired state (Git)** and **actual state (Kubernetes cluster)** are in sync.
- If changes are detected, ArgoCD applies them to the cluster.

## 2. Configuring the Reconciliation Timeout

The reconciliation timeout can be adjusted based on the deployment needs. This is done using the **ArgoCD repo serverâ€™s environment variable**.

### Steps to Configure Reconciliation Timeout:
1. **Check the current timeout settings:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get cm -n argocd argocd-cm -o yaml | grep reconciliation
   ```
2. **Modify the configuration map:**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: argocd-cm
     namespace: argocd
   data:
     timeout.reconciliation: "300" # Set to 5 minutes
   ```
3. **Apply the updated configuration:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f argocd-cm.yaml
   ```
4. **Restart the ArgoCD repo server to apply changes:**
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment argocd-repo-server -n argocd
   ```
5. After applying this change, ArgoCD will check for updates in the Git repository **every 5 minutes** instead of 3 minutes.

## 3. Using Webhooks to Improve Synchronization Efficiency

Instead of relying on periodic polling, ArgoCD can be configured to use **webhooks**. This enables ArgoCD to react immediately when changes are pushed to Git.

### Benefits of Webhooks:
- **Reduces polling delay** and minimizes unnecessary API requests.
- **Triggers synchronization instantly** when a push event occurs.
- **Improves performance** by ensuring faster updates.

### Steps to Configure a Webhook:
1. **In GitHub (or GitLab, BitBucket):**
   - Navigate to the repository settings.
   - Locate the **Webhooks** section.
   - Click **Add webhook**.
   - Set the **Payload URL** to:
     ```plaintext
     https://<argocd-server-url>/api/webhook
     ```
   - Select **application/json** as the content type.
   - Ensure the webhook is set for **push events**.
   - Click **Save**.

2. **Verify Webhook Events:**
   - Test the webhook by making a change in the Git repository.
   - Check ArgoCD logs to confirm that a webhook event was received:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs -f deployment/argocd-server -n argocd
     ```
   - You should see a log entry indicating that ArgoCD processed a webhook event.

3. **Enable Webhook Processing in ArgoCD:**
   - Ensure the following is set in `argocd-cm.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ConfigMap
     metadata:
       name: argocd-cm
       namespace: argocd
     data:
       webhook.enabled: "true"
     ```
   - Apply changes and restart the server:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f argocd-cm.yaml
     kubectl rollout restart deployment argocd-server -n argocd
     ```

Once configured, ArgoCD will react **instantly** to Git events, reducing reliance on periodic polling.

## Conclusion

The **reconciliation loop** ensures that Kubernetes applications always match the desired state defined in Git. While the default polling interval is **3 minutes**, this can be optimized using:

| Optimization Method | Benefit |
|----------------------|---------|
| **Increasing timeout value** | Reduces unnecessary checks, improving efficiency. |
| **Using Webhooks** | Ensures immediate synchronization, reducing delays. |
| **Restarting repo-server after updates** | Ensures configuration changes take effect. |

By configuring **custom reconciliation settings** and implementing **webhooks**, ArgoCD can achieve a highly efficient, real-time **GitOps deployment model**.
